# Stack Overflow Jobs Auto Apply
In order to use this you must download the firefox and the firefox web driver and put it somewhere in your path. You can find the driver here. https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases


```
git clone https://github.com/Catalyze326/Stack-Overfow-Auto-job-Apply.git
```
```
cd Stack-Overfow-Auto-job-Apply
```
````
pip3 install selenium
````
```
python3 main.py
```

Once you have that in your path and you have installed selenium and you answer its questions you should be able to let it run.

I got bored of applying to jobs so I wrote a program to do it for you. It simply asks for your username, password, work experience level, and filters in a text file and then references them wen looking through sites. I might slow it down so that Stack Overflow does not become suspicious, but right now I think it works.

I am going to build one of these for Linkedin in the form of a chrome extension for all the non programmers who still are lazy and dont want to apply to jobs themselves, but that is to come at a later date.
