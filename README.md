# Stack Overflow Jobs Auto Apply
In order to use this you must download the firefox web driver and put it somewhere in your path. You can find the driver here. https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

You will also need to install selenium with pip

````
pip3 install selenium
````

Once you have that in your path and you have installed selenium and you answer its questions you should be able to let it run.

I got bored of applying to jobs so I wrote a program to do it for you. It simply asks for your username, password, work experience level, and filters in a text file and then references them wen looking through sites. I might slow it down so that Stack Overflow does not become suspicious, but right now I think it works.

I am going to build one of thse for Linkedin for all the non programmers who still are lazy and dont want to apply to jobs themselves, but that is to come at a later date.
